#  Rotating Navigation Project

This is a visually engaging **Rotating Navigation** project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
When the user clicks on the hamburger icon, the main content rotates, and a navigation bar slides into view — creating a smooth and modern transition effect.

##  Features

-  **Rotating Animation:** The main content rotates smoothly when navigation opens.  
-  **Responsive Design:** Works well on desktop and mobile screens.  
-  **Toggle Menu:** Hamburger icon switches to a close (X) icon.  
-  **Embedded Article:** A complete article displayed within the main content area.  
-  **Modern UI:** Minimal, clean layout with Font Awesome icons.

##  How It Works

1. When the user clicks the **hamburger icon**, a `.show-nav` class is added to the `.container`.
2. This class triggers CSS transitions that:
   - Rotate the content area.
   - Spin the red circular background.
   - Reveal the navigation menu from the side.
3. When the **X icon** is clicked, the `.show-nav` class is removed, and everything returns to normal.

The included article — **“The Future of Web Development”** — highlights key trends like:
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
- Voice Search Integration
- WebAssembly
- AR/VR in Web
- Cybersecurity & Privacy

It demonstrates how web content can be beautifully presented inside an animated layout.
